<p>Local newsrooms that are doing innovative work informing and connecting with communities often don’t have access to the services that newsrooms in earlier times took for granted. Small newsrooms are often so busy with daily coverage they don’t even know about all the resources available to answer their community’s hardest questions.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why we created the Knight Election Hub, and why we’re picking up the check on costly services.</strong></p>
<p>The Hub is a collection of carefully selected products and services that will help you cover the election better than you thought possible.</p>
