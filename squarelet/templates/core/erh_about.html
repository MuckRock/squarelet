    <h1>About the Knight Election Hub</h1>
    <p>The Knight Election Hub provides free or reduced-price resources and services to U.S. newsrooms covering the 2024 elections and the critical period between Election Day and the presidential inauguration. These resources help publishers serve their audiences by giving them the information they need to make informed voting decisions, have confidence in the election process and results, and understand the role newsrooms play in providing reliable civic information. They’re also designed to support journalists and newsrooms in a variety of post-election breaking news scenarios, where our Election Urgent Care project, done in partnership with Hearken and OpenNews, will provide on-call rapid response for news outlets across the country.</p>
    <h2>Election Urgent Care</h2>
    <p>Beginning November 5, this coalition of groups led by the Knight Election Hub, OpenNews and Hearken will provide rapid resource matching for election-related support services in the following focus areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Safety, including digital defense from online threats, cybersecurity, and physical security.</li>
      <li>Advice on election law.</li>
      <li>Journalistic strategy and expertise on how to cover unexpected tactics and events related to election administration.</li>
      <li>Document and data gathering from states and municipalities</li>
      <li>Data wrangling and analysis for newsrooms that lack data journalism capacity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re also standing by to add additional resources for needs we haven’t yet anticipated.</p>
    <p>Our presumption is that we'll serve smaller newsrooms with less internal capacity and fewer resources. Our eligibility criteria are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Newsrooms must be based in the U.S. and be substantially engaged in original, nonpartisan news gathering.</li>
      <li>Freelancers and independent journalists must be working on assignment for a newsroom that meets the above criterion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Journalists in well-resourced newsrooms might be directed to their internal teams for assistance.</p>
    <p>Our team members will be on-call in the weeks after Election Day. Reachable through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHzvJxx8WRY-Z3b84m3VHkfp2HV8vQ-Kr6ZMLypHNdhsz6hA/viewform" target="_blank">Slack community</a> or by emailing <a href="mailto:urgentcare@electionsos.org">urgentcare@electionsos.org</a>, we’ll match newsrooms facing coverage challenges or seeking added support for their journalists with the specific resource that will help. And while some of these resources are already freely available to newsrooms &mdash; for the ones that incur costs, we are picking up the check.</p>
